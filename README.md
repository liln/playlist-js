## Music Playlist in Javascript

This is an example of a music playlist module that contains track objects, saved as title and artist. The module allows the tracks that are added to be privately stored so as to not change the track attributes after being added.

Public functions include adding tracks to the playlist, getting the number of tracks on the playlist, getting a random track from the list, and listing all the tracks in the playlist.
